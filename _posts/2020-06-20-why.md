So why am I creating this blog?

I don't plan on writing long step by step articles, and I don't plan on writing anything about my day job as a Tech 
Lead. Programming is my hobby as well as my job, and I want this blog to be a way for me to document what I'm tinkering 
with as part of that hobby.

I have a long history of starting an endless stream of side projects that mostly never see the light of day. I'm hoping 
that forcing myself to post about them here it will help me consolidate those efforts and, if nothing else, provide something 
I can look back on.
