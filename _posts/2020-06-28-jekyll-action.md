I've realised that in order for the [Blog Editor](./blog-editor-app) to be useful I need to streamline the publishing process. Due to some 
plugins I'm using I need to run the build locally then manually push the generated static files to `gh-pages` 
branch. 

GitHub provides a lightweight CI system called GitHub Actions that should be able to run the build for each 
commit to master and push the static files to the `gh-pages` branch automatically. Surprisingly I have not tried GitHub 
Actions yet so this is a good opportunity to try them out.  

I found this existing custom Jekyll Action [here](https://github.com/helaili/jekyll-action) that would do the job. 

It's very simple to implement, just add the following config to `.github/workflows/github-pages.yml`. 

```yaml
name: Build and deploy Jekyll site to GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  github-pages:
    runs-on: ubuntu-16.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: helaili/jekyll-action@2.0.3
        env:
          JEKYLL_PAT: ${ { secrets.JEKYLL_PAT }}
```

Now all I need to do is push changes to the markdown files and it'll all get deployed automatically. 

My next problem is, how do I make a git commit from an iOS app? ðŸ¤”
